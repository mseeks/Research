[Sidenote E: Such a foal nor a knight were never before seen.]

[Sidenote A: The knight carried neither spear nor shield,]
[Sidenote B: In one hand was a holly bough,]
[Sidenote C: in the other an axe,]
[Sidenote D: the edge of which was as keen as a sharp razor,]
[Sidenote E: and the handle was encased in iron, curiously "graven with
  green, in gracious works."]
[Sidenote F: Thus arrayed the Green Knight enters the hall,]
[Sidenote G: without saluting any one.]

[Sidenote A: Much they marvel to see a man and a horse]
[Sidenote B: as green as grass.]
[Sidenote C: Never before had they seen such a sight as this.]
[Sidenote D: They were afraid to answer,]
[Sidenote E: and were as silent as if sleep had taken possession of them;]
[Sidenote F: some from fear and others from courtesy.]

         For had I founded in fere, in fe3tyng wyse,
 268 [F] I haue a hauberghe at home & a helme boþe,
         A schelde, & a scharp spere, schinande bry3t,
         Ande oþer weppenes to welde, I wene wel als,
         Bot for I wolde no were, my wede3 ar softer.
 272     Bot if þou be so bold as alle burne3 tellen,
         Þou wyl grant me godly þe gomen þat I ask,

     [G]     Arthour con onsware,
 276         & sayd, "sir cortays kny3t,
             If þou craue batayl bare,
             Here fayle3 þou not to fy3t."

[Sidenote A: Arthur salutes the Green Knight.]
[Sidenote B: bids him welcome, and invites him to stay awhile.]
[Sidenote C: The knight says that he will not tarry.]
[Sidenote D: He seeks the most valiant that he may prove him.]
[Sidenote E: He comes in peace.]
[Sidenote F: At home, however, he has both shield and spear.]
[Sidenote G: Arthur assures him that he shall not fail to find an opponent
  worthy of him.]

      XIII.

     [A] "Nay, frayst I no fy3t, in fayth I þe telle,
 280 [B] Hit arn aboute on þis bench bot berdle3 chylder;
         If I were hasped in armes on a he3e stede,

         For-þy I craue in þis court a crystmas gomen,

             Now hy3e, & let se tite

[Sidenote A: "I seek no fight," says the knight.]
[Sidenote B: "'Here are only beardless children.']
[Sidenote C: Here is no man to match me.]
[Sidenote D: Here are brave ones many,]
[Sidenote E: if any be bold enough to 'strike a stroke for another,']
[Sidenote F: this axe shall be his;]
[Sidenote G: but I shall give him a 'stroke' in return]
[Sidenote H: within a twelvemonth and a day."]
[Footnote 1: MS. fo.]

      XIV.

     [A] If he hem stowned vpon fyrst, stiller were þanne
         Alle þe hered-men in halle, þe hy3 & þe lo3e;
     [B] Þe renk on his rounce hym ruched in his sadel,
 304     & runisch-ly his rede y3en he reled aboute,
     [C] Bende his bresed bro3e3, bly-cande grene,
     [D] Wayued his berde for to wayte quo-so wolde ryse.
         When non wolde kepe hym with carp he co3ed ful hy3e,
 308     Ande rimed hym ful richley, & ry3t hym to speke:
     [E] "What, is þis Arþures hous," quod þe haþel þenne,
         "Þat al þe rous rennes of, þur3 ryalmes so mony?
         Where is now your sourquydrye & your conquestes,

     [F] Now is þe reuel & þe renoun of þe rounde table
         Ouer-walt wyth a worde of on wy3es speche;

 316     Wyth þis he la3es so loude, þat þe lorde greued;

 320         So did alle þat þer were
             Þe kyng as kene bi kynde,
             Þen stod þat stif mon nere.

[Sidenote A: Fear kept all silent.]
[Sidenote B: The knight rolled his red eyes about,]
[Sidenote C: and bent his bristly green brows.]
[Sidenote D: Waving his beard awhile, he exclaimed:]
[Sidenote E: "What! is this Arthur's court?]
[Sidenote F: Forsooth the renown of the Round Table is overturned 'with a
  word of one man's speech.'"]
[Sidenote G: Arthur blushes for shame.]
[Sidenote H: He waxes as wroth as the wind.]

      XV.

     [A] Ande sayde, "haþel, by heuen þyn askyng is nys,
 324     & as þou foly hat3 frayst, fynde þe be-houes;
         I know no gome þat is gast of þy grete wordes.

 328     Ly3tly lepe3 he hym to, & la3t at his honde;           [Fol. 95b.]
         Þen feersly þat oþer freke vpon fote ly3tis.
     [B] Now hat3 Arthure his axe, & þe halme grype3,
         & sturnely sture3 hit aboute, þat stryke wyth hit þo3t.
 332     Þe stif mon hym bifore stod vpon hy3t,
         Herre þen ani in þe hous by þe hede & more;
     [C] Wyth sturne schere[1] þer he stod, he stroked his berde,
         & wyth a countenaunce dry3e he dro3 doun his cote,
 336     No more mate ne dismayd for hys mayn dinte3,
         Þen any burne vpon bench hade bro3t hym to drynk

 340         To þe kyng he can enclyne,
             "I be-seche now with sa3e3 sene,
             Þis melly mot be myne."

[Sidenote A: He assures the knight that no one is afraid of his great
  words.]
[Sidenote B: Arthur seizes his axe.]
[Sidenote C: The knight, stroking his beard, awaits the blow, and with a
  "dry countenance" draws down his coat.]
[Sidenote D: Sir Gawayne beseeches the king to let him undertake the blow.]
[Footnote 1: chere (?).]

      XVI.

         "Wolde 3e, worþilych lorde," quod Gawan to þe kyng,
 344 [A] "Bid me bo3e fro þis benche, & stonde by yow þere,
         Þat I wyth-oute vylanye my3t voyde þis table,

 364        To ryd þe kyng wyth croun,
            & gif Gawan þe game.

[Sidenote A: He asks permission to leave the table; he says,]
[Sidenote B: it is not meet that Arthur should be active in the matter,]
[Sidenote C: while so many bold ones sit upon bench.]
[Sidenote D: Although the weakest, he is quite ready to meet the Green
  Knight.]
[Sidenote E: The nobles entreat Arthur to "give Gawayne the game."]

      XVII.

         Þen comaunded þe kyng þe kny3t for to ryse;             [Fol. 96.]
         & he ful radly vp ros, & ruchched hym fayre,
 368 [A] Kneled doun bifore þe kyng, & cache3 þat weppen;

 372     "Kepe þe cosyn," quod þe kyng, "þat þou on kyrf sette,
         & if þou rede3 hym ry3t, redly I trowe,
         Þat þou schal byden þe bur þat he schal bede after.

 388 [E]     As I am ferly fayn.
             Þis dint þat þou schal dryue."

[Sidenote A: The king gives his nephew his weapon,]
[Sidenote B: and tells him to keep heart and hand steady.]
[Sidenote C: The Green Knight enquires the name of his opponent.]
[Sidenote D: Sir Gawayne tells him his name, and declares that he is
  willing to give and receive a blow.]
[Sidenote E: The other thereof is glad.]
[Footnote 1: MS. fo.]

      XVIII.

     [A] "Bigog," quod þe grene kny3t, "sir Gawan, melykes,

             "Gladly sir, for soþe,"
 416         Quod Gawan; his ax he strokes.

[Sidenote A: "It pleases me well, Sir Gawayne," says the Green Knight,
  "that I shall receive a blow from thy fist; but thou must swear that thou
  wilt seek me,]
[Sidenote B: to receive the blow in return."]
[Sidenote C: "Where shall I seek thee?" says Sir Gawayne;]
[Sidenote D: "tell me thy name and abode and I will find thee."]
[Sidenote E: "When thou hast smitten me," says the knight, "then tell I
  thee of my home and name;]
[Sidenote F: if I speak not at all, so much the better for thee.]
[Sidenote G: Take now thy grim tool, and let us see how thou knockest."]

     [A] The grene kny3t vpon grounde grayþely hym dresses,
         A littel lut with þe hede, þe lere he discouere3,
     [B] His longe louelych lokke3 he layd ouer his croun.
 420     Let þe naked nec to þe note schewe.
         Gauan gripped to his ax, & gederes hit on hy3t,

[Sidenote A: The Green Knight]
[Sidenote B: puts his long lovely locks aside and lays bare his neck.]
[Sidenote C: Sir Gawayne lets fall his axe]
[Sidenote D: and severs the head from the body.]
[Sidenote E: The head falls to the earth.]
[Sidenote F: Many kick it aside with their feet.]
[Sidenote G: The knight never falters;]
[Sidenote H: he rushes forth, seizes his head,]
[Sidenote I: steps into the saddle,]
[Sidenote J: holding the while the head in his hand by the hair,]
[Sidenote K: and turns his horse about.]
[Footnote 1: MS. ho.]

 444     For þe hede in his honde he halde3 vp euen,
     [A] To-ward þe derrest on þe dece he dresse3 þe face,

 448     "Loke, Gawan, þou be grayþe to go as þou hette3,

  hast promised,]
[Sidenote C: and seek till thou findest me.]
[Sidenote D: Get thee to the Green Chapel,]
[Sidenote E: there to receive a blow on New Year's morn.]
[Sidenote F: Fail thou never;]
[Sidenote G: come, or recreant be called."]
[Sidenote H: The Green Knight then rushes out of the hall, his head in his

[Sidenote I: At that green one Arthur and Gawayne "laugh and grin."]

[Sidenote D: Sir Gawayne, hang up thine axe.]
[Sidenote E: The king and his knights sit feasting at the board till day is

[Sidenote A: This marvel serves to keep up a brisk conversation in Court.]
[Sidenote B: The year passes full quickly and never returns.]
[Sidenote C: After Christmas comes the "crabbed Lenten."]
[Sidenote D: Spring sets in and warm showers descend;]
[Sidenote E: the groves become green,]
[Sidenote F: birds build and sing,]
[Sidenote G: for joy of the summer that follows;]
[Sidenote H: blossoms begin to bloom,]
[Sidenote I: and noble notes are heard in the woods]

[Sidenote A: Then the soft winds of summer,]
[Sidenote B: beautiful are the flowers wet with dew-drops.]
[Sidenote C: But harvest approaches soon,]
[Sidenote D: and drives the dust about.]
[Sidenote E: The leaves drop off the trees,]
[Sidenote F: the grass becomes gray, and all ripens and rots.]
[Sidenote G: Winter winds round again,]
[Sidenote H: and then Sir Gawayne thinks of his dread journey.]

      III.

 536 [A] 3et quyl al-hal-day with Arþer he lenges,
         & he made a fare on þat fest, for þe freke3 sake,

 564 [G]     Of destines derf & dere,
             What may mon do bot fonde?"

[Sidenote A: On All-hallows day Arthur makes a feast for his nephew's
  sake.]
[Sidenote B: After meat, Sir Gawayne thus speaks to his uncle:]
[Sidenote C: "Now, liege lord, I ask leave of you,]
[Sidenote D: for I am bound on the morn to seek the Green Knight."]
[Sidenote E: Many nobles, the best of the court, counsel and comfort him.]
[Sidenote F: Much sorrow prevails in the hall.]
[Sidenote G: Gawayne declares that he has nothing to fear.]
[Footnote 1: derne (?).]

      IV.

     [A] He dowelle3 þer al þat day, and dresse3 on þe morn,
         Aske3 erly hys arme3, & alle were þay bro3t

     [E] Þenne set þay þe sabatoun3 vpon þe segge fote3,
         His lege3 lapped in stel with luflych greue3,
 576     With polayne3 piched þer-to, policed ful clene,

[Sidenote A: On the morn he asks for his arms.]
[Sidenote B: A carpet is spread on the floor,]
[Sidenote C: and he steps thereon.]
[Sidenote D: He is dubbed in a doublet of Tarsic silk, and a well-made
  hood.]
[Sidenote E: They set steel slices on his feet, and lap his legs in steel
  greaves.]
[Sidenote F: Fair cuisses enclose his thighs,]
[Sidenote G: and afterwards they put on the steel habergeon,]
[Sidenote H: well-burnished braces, elbow pieces, and gloves of plate.]
[Sidenote I: Over all this is placed the coat armour.]
[Sidenote J: His spurs are then fixed,]
[Sidenote K: and his sword is attached to his side by a silken girdle.]

      V.

     [A] When he wat3 hasped in armes, his harnays wat3 ryche,  [Fol. 99a.]
         Þe lest lachet ou[þ]er loupe lemed of golde;
 592     So harnayst as he wat3 he herkne3 his masse,
         Offred & honoured at þe he3e auter;
     [B] Syþen he come3 to þe kyng & to his cort fere3,
         Lache3 lufly his leue at lorde3 & ladye3;
 596     & þay hym kyst & conueyed, bikende hym to kryst.
     [C] Bi þat wat3 Gryngolet grayth, & gurde with a sadel,
         Þat glemed ful gayly with mony golde frenges,
         Ay quere naylet ful nwe for þat note ryched;
 600     Þe brydel barred aboute, with bry3t golde bounden;
     [D] Þe apparayl of þe payttrure, & of þe proude skyrte3,
         Þe cropore, & þe couertor, acorded wyth þe arsoune3;
         & al wat3 rayled on red ryche golde nayle3,
 604     Þat al glytered & glent as glem of þe sunne.
     [E] Þenne hentes he þe holme, & hastily hit kysses,
         Þat wat3 stapled stifly, & stoffed wyth-inne:
         Hit wat3 hy3e on his hede, hasped bihynde,
 608 [F] Wyth a ly3tli vrysoun ouer þe auentayle,
     [G] Enbrawden & bounden wyth þe best gemme3,
         On brode sylkyn borde, & brydde3 on seme3,
         As papiaye3 paynted pernyng bitwene,
 612     Tortors & trulofe3 entayled so þyk,
         As mony burde þer aboute had ben seuen wynter
                 in toune;
     [H]     Þe cercle wat3 more o prys,
 616         Þat vmbe-clypped hys croun,
             Of diamaunte3 a deuys,
             Þat boþe were bry3t & broun.

[Sidenote A: Thus arrayed the knight hears mass,]
[Sidenote B: and afterwards takes leave of Arthur and his court.]
[Sidenote C: By that time his horse Gringolet was ready,]
[Sidenote D: the harness of which glittered like the "gleam of the sun."]
[Sidenote E: Then Sir Gawayne sets his helmet upon his head,]
[Sidenote F: fastened behind with a "urisoun,"]
[Sidenote G: richly embroidered with gems.]
[Sidenote H: The circle around the helmet was decked with diamonds.]

      VI.

     [A] Then þay schewed hym þe schelde, þat was of schyr goule3,
 620     Wyth þe pentangel de-paynt of pure golde hwe3;
         He brayde3 hit by þe baude-ryk, aboute þe hals kestes,
         Þat bisemed þe segge semlyly fayre.
     [B] & quy þe pentangel apende3 to þat prynce noble,
 624     I am in tent yow to telle, þof tary hyt me schulde;
         Hit is a syngne þat Salamon set sum-quyle,
         In bytoknyng of trawþe, bi tytle þat hit habbe3,
         For hit is a figure þat halde3 fyue poynte3,            [Fol. 99b]
 628     & vche lyne vmbe-lappe3 & louke3 in oþer,
     [C] & ay quere hit is endele3,[1] & Englych hit callen
         Ouer-al, as I here, þe endeles knot.
         For-þy hit acorde3 to þis kny3t, & to his cler arme3,
 632     For ay faythful in fyue & sere fyue syþe3,
     [D] Gawan wat3 for gode knawen, & as golde pured,
         Voyded of vche vylany, wyth vertue3[2] ennourned
                 in mote;
 636         For-þy þe pen-tangel nwe
             He ber in schelde & cote,
     [E]     As tulk of tale most trwe,
             & gentylest kny3t of lote.

[Sidenote A: Then they show him his shield with the "pentangle" of pure
  gold.]
[Sidenote B: The "pentangle" was devised by Solomon as a token of truth.]
[Sidenote C: It is called the endless knot]
[Sidenote D: It well becomes the good Sir Gawayne,]
[Sidenote E: a knight the truest of speech and the fairest of form.]
[Footnote 1: MS emdele3.]
[Footnote 2: MS verertue3]

      VII.

 640 [A] Fyrst he wat3 funden fautle3 in his fyue wytte3,
         & efte fayled neuer þe freke in his fyue fyngres,
     [B] & alle his afyaunce vpon folde wat3 in þe fyue wounde3
         Þat Cryst ka3t on þe croys, as þe crede telle3;
 644     & quere-so-euer þys mon in melly wat3 stad,
         His þro þo3t wat3 in þat, þur3 alle oþer þynge3,
         Þat alle his forsnes he fong at þe fyue ioye3,
         Þat þe hende heuen quene had of hir chylde;
 648     At þis cause þe kny3t comlyche hade
     [C] In þe more half of his schelde hir ymage depaynted,
         Þat quen he blusched þerto, his belde neuer payred.
         Þe fyrst[1] fyue þat I finde þat þe frek vsed,
 652     Wat3 fraunchyse, & fela3schyp for-be[2] al þyng;
     [D] His clannes & his cortaysye croked were neuer,
         & pite, þat passe3 alle poynte3, þyse pure fyue
         Were harder happed on þat haþel þen on any oþer.
 656     Now alle þese fyue syþe3, forsoþe, were fetled on þis kny3t,
         & vchone halched in oþer, þat non ende hade,
         & fyched vpon fyue poynte3, þat fayld neuer,
         Ne samned neuer in no syde, ne sundred nouþ[er],
 660     With-outen ende at any noke [a]i quere fynde,
         Where-euer þe gomen bygan, or glod to an ende.
     [E] Þer-fore on his schene schelde schapen wat3 þe knot,
         Þus alle wyth red golde vpon rede gowle3,
 664     Þat is þe pure pentaungel wyth þe peple called,         [Fol. 100]
                 with lore.
             Now grayþed is Gawan gay,
     [F]     & la3t his launce ry3t þore,
 668         & gef hem alle goud day,
             He wende for euer more.

[Sidenote A: He was found faultless in his five wits.]
[Sidenote B: His trust was in the five wounds.]
[Sidenote C: The image of the Virgin was depicted upon his shield.]
[Sidenote D: In cleanness and courtesy he was never found wanting,]
[Sidenote E: therefore was the endless knot fastened on his shield.]
[Sidenote F: Sir Gawayne seizes his lance and bids all "good day."]
[Footnote 1: MS fyft.]
[Footnote 2: for-bi (?).]

      VIII.

     [A] He sperred þe sted with þe spure3, & sprong on his way,
         So stif þat þe ston fyr stroke out þer-after;
 672 [B] Al þat se3 þat semly syked in hert,
         & sayde soþly al same segges til oþer,
         Carande for þat comly, "bi Kryst, hit is scaþe,
         Þat þou, leude, schal be lost, þat art of lyf noble!
 676 [C] To fynde hys fere vpon folde, in fayth is not eþe;
         Warloker to haf wro3t had more wyt bene,
         & haf dy3t 3onder dere a duk to haue worþed;
     [D] A lowande leder of lede3 in londe hym wel seme3,

     [E] Hadet wyth an aluisch mon, for angarde3 pryde.
         Who knew euer any kyng such counsel to take,

 684 [F] Wel much wat3 þe warme water þat waltered of y3en,

     [G]     Mony wylsum way he rode,
             Þe bok as I herde say.

[Sidenote A: He spurs his horse and goes on his way.]
[Sidenote B: All that saw that seemly one mourned in their hearts.]
[Sidenote C: They declared that his equal was not to be found upon earth.]
[Sidenote D: It would have been better for him to have been a leader of
  men,]
[Sidenote E: than to die by the hands of "an elvish man."]
[Sidenote F: Much was the warm water that poured from eyes that day.]
[Sidenote G: Meanwhile many a weary way goes Sir Gawayne.]
[Footnote 1: MS. þad.]

      IX.

     [A] Now ride3 þis renk þur3 þe ryalme of Logres,

         & ay he frayned, as he ferde, at freke3 þat he met,
 704 [F] If þay hade herde any karp of a kny3t grene,
         In any grounde þer-aboute, of þe grene chapel;[2]

[Sidenote A: Now rides the knight through the realms of England.]
[Sidenote B: He has no companion but his horse.]
[Sidenote C: No men does he see till he approaches North Wales.]
[Sidenote D: From Holyhead he passes into Wirral.]
[Sidenote E: There he finds but few that loved God or man.]
[Sidenote F: He enquires after the Green Knight of the Green Chapel,]
[Sidenote G: but can gain no tidings of him.]
[Sidenote H: His cheer oft changed before he found the Chapel.]
[Footnote 1: nyghe (?).]
[Footnote 2: MS. clapel.]

[Sidenote A: Many a cliff he climbed over;]
[Sidenote B: many a ford and stream he crossed, and everywhere he found a
  foe.]
[Sidenote C: It were too tedious to tell the tenth part of his adventures]
[Sidenote D: with serpents, wolves, and wild men;]
[Sidenote E: with bulls, bears, and boars.]
[Sidenote F: Had he not been both brave and good, doubtless he had been
  dead.]
[Sidenote G: The sharp winter was far worse than any war that ever troubled
  him.]
[Sidenote H: Thus in peril he travels till Christmas-eve.]
[Sidenote I: To the Virgin Mary he prays to guide him to some abode.]

      XI.

 740 [A] Bi a mounte on þe morne meryly he rydes,
         Into a forest ful dep, þat ferly wat3 wylde,

             He rode in his prayere,

[Sidenote D: Very sorrowful was that fair one on account of his refusal.]

  it.]
[Sidenote C: For he who is girded with this green lace,]
[Sidenote D: cannot be wounded or slain."]
[Sidenote E: The knight thinks of his adventure at the Green Chapel.]
[Sidenote F: The lady presses him to accept the lace.]

  possession of it a secret.]

[Sidenote C: Gawayne takes leave of his host.]
[Sidenote D: and thanks him for his happy "sojourn."]
[Sidenote E: He asks for a man to teach him the way to the Green Chapel.]

[Sidenote G: Men knock off the rust from his rich habergeon.]
[Sidenote H: The knight then calls for his steed.]

[Sidenote A: While he clothed himself in his rich weeds,]
[Sidenote B: he forgot not the "lace," the lady's gift,]
[Sidenote C: but with it doubly girded his loins.]
[Sidenote D: He wore it not for its rich ornaments,]
[Sidenote E: "but to save himself when it behoved him to suffer."]
[Sidenote F: All the renowned assembly he thanks full oft.]
[Footnote 1: vertuous (?).]

[Sidenote A: Then was Gringolet arrayed,]
[Sidenote B: full ready to prick on.]
[Sidenote C: Gawayne returns thanks for the honour and kindness shown to
  him by all.]
[Sidenote D: He then steps into his saddle,]
[Sidenote E: and "starts on the stone" without more delay.]
[Sidenote F: "This castle to Christ I commend; may he give it ever good
  chance!"]

     [A] The brygge wat3 brayde doun, & þe brode 3ate3

[Sidenote A: The gates are soon opened.]
[Sidenote B: The knight passes thereout,]
[Sidenote C: and goes on his way accompanied by his guide.]
[Sidenote D: They climb by cliffs,]
[Sidenote E: where each "hill had a hat and a mist-cloak,"]
[Sidenote F: until daylight.]
[Sidenote G: They were then on a "hill full high."]
[Sidenote H: The servant bade his master abide, saying,]

[Sidenote A: "I have brought you hither,]
[Sidenote B: ye are not now far from the noted place.]
[Sidenote C: Full perilous is it esteemed.]
[Sidenote D: The lord of that 'waste' is stiff and stern.]
[Sidenote E: His body is bigger 'than the best four in Arthur's house.']
[Sidenote F: None passes by the Green Chapel, 'that he does not ding to

[Sidenote G: For be it churl or chaplain, monk, mass-priest, 'or any man
  else,' he kills them all.]
[Sidenote H: He has lived there full long.]
[Sidenote I: Against his dints sore ye may not defend you.]

[Sidenote B: Go by some other region,]
[Sidenote C: I swear by God and all His saints, that I will never say that
  ever ye attempted to flee from any man."]
[Sidenote D: Gawayne replies that to shun this danger would mark him as a
  "coward knight."]
[Sidenote E: To the Chapel, therefore, he will go,]
[Sidenote F: though the owner thereof were a stern knave.]
[Sidenote G: "Full well can God devise his servants for to save."]

[Sidenote F: Having thus spoken the guide takes leave of the knight.]
[Sidenote G: "By God's self," says Sir Gawayne, "I will neither weep nor

[Sidenote A: Then he pursues his journey,]
[Sidenote B: rides through the dale, and looks about.]
[Sidenote C: He sees no sign of a resting-place, but only high and steep
  banks.]
[Sidenote D: No chapel could he discern.]
[Sidenote E: At last he sees a hill by the side of a stream;]
[Sidenote F: thither he goes,]
[Sidenote G: alights and fastens his horse to a branch of a tree.]
[Sidenote H: He walks around the hill, debating with himself what it might

[Sidenote I: and at last finds an old cave in the crag.]
[Sidenote J: He prays that about midnight he may tell his matins.]

[Sidenote A: "Truly," says Sir Gawayne, "a desert is here,]
[Sidenote B: a fitting place for the man in green to 'deal here his
  devotions in devil fashion.']
[Sidenote C: It is most cursed kirk that ever I entered."]
[Sidenote D: Roaming about he hears a loud noise,]
[Sidenote E: from beyond the brook.]
[Sidenote F: It clattered like the grinding of a scythe on a grindstone.]
[Sidenote G: It whirred like a mill-stream.]
[Sidenote H: "Though my life I forgo," says the knight, "no noise shall
  terrify me."]

[Sidenote A: Then cried he aloud,]
[Sidenote B: "Who dwells here discourse with me to hold?"]
[Sidenote C: Now is the good Gawayne going aright]
[Sidenote D: He hears a voice commanding him to abide where he is.]
[Sidenote E: Soon there comes out of a hole, with a fell weapon,]
[Sidenote F: a Danish axe, quite new,]
[Sidenote G: the "knight in green," clothed as before.]
[Sidenote H: When he reaches the stream, he hops over and strides about.]
[Sidenote I: He meets Sir Gawayne without obeisance.]
[Sidenote J: The other tells him that he is now ready for conversation]

[Sidenote A: "God preserve thee!" says the Green Knight,]
[Sidenote B: "as a true knight 'thou hast timed thy travel']
[Sidenote C: Thou knowest the covenant between us,]
[Sidenote D: that on New Year's day I should return thy blow]
[Sidenote E: Here we are alone,]
[Sidenote F: Have off thy helmet and take thy pay at once."]
[Sidenote G: "By God," quoth Sir Gawayne, "I shall not begrudge thee thy

[Sidenote H: Then he shows his bare neck,]
[Sidenote I: and appears undaunted.]

[Sidenote A: Then the man in green seizes his grim tool.]
[Sidenote B: With all his force he raises it aloft.]
[Sidenote C: As it came gliding down,]
[Sidenote D: Sir Gawayne shrank a little with his shoulders.]
[Sidenote E: The other reproved him, saying,]
[Sidenote F: "Thou art not Gawayne that is so good esteemed,]
[Sidenote G: for thou fleest for fear before thou feelest harm.]
[Sidenote H: I never flinched when thou struckest.]
[Sidenote I: My head flew to my foot, yet I never fled,]
[Sidenote J: wherefore I ought to be called the better man."]
[Sidenote K: "I shunted once," says Gawayne, "but will no more.]

[Sidenote A: Bring me to the point; deal me my destiny at once."]
[Sidenote B: "Have at thee, then," says the other.]
[Sidenote C: With that he aims at him a blow.]
[Sidenote D: Gawayne never flinches, but stands as still as a stone.]
[Sidenote E: "Now," says the Green Knight, "I must hit thee, since thy
  heart is whole."]
[Sidenote F: "Thrash on," says the other.]
[Sidenote G: Then the Green Knight makes ready to strike.]
[Footnote 1: ? ryne3 = touches.]

     [A] He lyftes ly3tly his lome, & let hit doun fayre,

[Sidenote A: He let fall his loom on the bare]
[Sidenote B: neck of Sir Gawayne.]
[Sidenote C: The sharp weapon pierced the flesh so that the blood flowed.]
[Sidenote D: When the knight saw the blood on the snow,]
[Sidenote E: he unsheathed his sword, and thus spake:]
[Sidenote F: "Cease, man, of thy blow.]
[Sidenote G: If thou givest me any more, readily shall I requite thee.]
[Sidenote H: Our agreement stipulates only one stroke."]
[Footnote 1: Illegible.]

     [A] The haþel heldet hym fro, & on his ax rested,

[Sidenote A: The Green Knight rested on his axe,]
[Sidenote B: looked on Sir Gawayne, who appeared bold and fearless,]
[Sidenote C: and addressed him as follows: "Bold knight, be not so wroth,]
[Sidenote D: I promised thee a stroke and thou hast it, be satisfied.]
[Sidenote E: I could have dealt worse with thee.]
[Sidenote F: I menaced thee with one blow for the covenant between us on
  the first night.]
[Sidenote G: Another I aimed at thee because thou kissedst my wife.]
[Sidenote H: A true man should restore truly, and then he need fear no
  harm.]
[Sidenote I: Thou failedst at the third time, and therefore take thee that
  tap. (See l. 1861.)]

[Sidenote A: For my weed (woven by my wife) thou wearest.]
[Sidenote B: I know thy kisses and my wife's wooing.]
[Sidenote C: I sent her to try thee, and faultless I found thee.]
[Sidenote D: But yet thou sinnedst a little,]
[Sidenote E: for love of thy life."]
[Sidenote F: Gawayne stands confounded.]
[Sidenote G: "Cursed," he says, "be cowardice and covetousness both!"]
[Sidenote H: Then he takes off the girdle and throws it to the knight.]
[Sidenote I: He curses his cowardice,]
[Sidenote J: and confesses himself to have been guilty of untruth.]
[Sidenote K: ]

      XVII.

     [A] Thenne lo3e þat oþer leude, & luflyly sayde,

             We schal yow wel acorde,
             Þat wat3 your enmy kene."

[Sidenote A: Then the other, laughing, thus spoke:]
[Sidenote B: "Thou art confessed so clean,]
[Sidenote C: that I hold thee as pure as if thou hadst never been guilty.]
[Sidenote D: I give thee, sir, the gold-hemmed girdle,]
[Sidenote E: as a token of thy adventure at the Green Chapel.]
[Sidenote F: Come again to my abode, and abide there for the remainder of
  the festival."]

[Sidenote A: "Nay, forsooth," says Gawayne,]
[Sidenote B: "I have sojourned sadly, but bliss betide thee!]
[Sidenote C: Commend me to your comely wife and that other lady who have
  beguiled me.]
